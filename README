PSP Music Center by RNB_PSP

Description
      This is a music player for the Sony PSP powered by
 FFMpeg which means you can play all audio codecs from any
 container format supported by ffmpeg(http://ffmpeg.org/general.html).
 This also makes use of the PSP's hardware decoders for
 some codecs.

NOTES:
 Since this is an initial release, program is expected to be buggy,
 only stereo signed 16bit audio with the ff. sample rates
 will play correctly:
    48000, 44100, 32000, 24000, 22050, 16000, 12000, 11050, 8000
 
 and no support for ATRAC3+ yet.
 
 Since FFMpeg supports a lot of container formats and codecs,
 I do not have the time to test if all of it works correctly.
 I have only tested the ff.: codec(file extension)
		ATRAC3(at3 from umd)
    MP3(mp3, flv)
    AAC(aac, mp4, m4a)
    WMAv2(wma)
    FLAC(flac)
    signed 16bit PCM(wav)

 for playing. Not all formats supported are listed in it but you can add your
 own extensions.
